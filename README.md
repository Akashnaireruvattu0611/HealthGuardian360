## 📘 Project Overview

**HealthGuardian360** is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline and interactive dashboard designed to help healthcare organizations **predict which patients are likely to have high utilization of services** in the next 12 months. 

This project demonstrates **real-world data engineering, feature engineering, model comparison, and business intelligence visualization** using synthetic healthcare data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Forecast high healthcare utilization based on patient demographics and historical encounters.
- Compare multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for non-technical stakeholders.
- Provide clear insights to help healthcare providers plan resources proactively.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - XGBoost
- **PostgreSQL** – for data storage
- **Power BI** – interactive dashboard
- **Jupyter Notebook** – data exploration and modeling
- **Streamlit (optional future enhancement)** – for live prediction apps

## 🧩 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion
- Downloaded synthetic patient, encounters, and conditions datasets.
- Loaded into **PostgreSQL**.
- Cleaned data:
  - Handled missing values.
  - Standardized columns.

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Created:
  - **Age**
  - **Encounters in last 12 months**
- Defined **target variable:**
  - `1` if >1 encounter in past year.
  - `0` otherwise.

### 3️⃣ Modeling
- Split into training and test datasets.
- Trained and evaluated:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Compared model accuracy and F1 scores.

### 4️⃣ Prediction
- Generated predictions for all patients.
- Saved results to CSV for visualization.

### 5️⃣ Visualization
- Built **Power BI Dashboard** with:
  - KPI card showing total predicted high-risk patients.
  - Clustered bar chart (age vs predicted risk).
  - Pie charts comparing models.
  - Table showing actual vs predicted.
  - Gender slicer filter.

## 📈 Model Performance

| Model               | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~87%     |
| Random Forest       | ~90%     |
| **XGBoost**         | **~92%** |

✅ **XGBoost** selected as the primary model for predictions.
